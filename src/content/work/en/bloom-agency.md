  title: 'The Brief'
  subtitle: 'Bold branding for a fast-moving SaaS startup.'
  body: >
    <p>Bloom Agency came to us with a clear challenge: create a brand that speaks directly to Gen Z-led remote teams—confident, expressive, and built for collaboration. Their product was already powerful, but their identity and online presence lacked the energy and clarity to back it up.</p>
    <p>We worked hand-in-hand with their leadership and creative teams to develop a vibrant new brand system, complete with bold motion, social-first layouts, and a voice that inspires connection across screens.</p>

    <p>We overhauled Bloom’s visual identity from the ground up, with a bold type system, flexible grids, and a color palette ready for social and web. Motion brought the brand to life, while detailed guidelines made it scalable.</p>
    <p>Landing pages for product rollouts were designed to convert fast, using a clear hierarchy and custom illustrations that reflected Bloom’s voice and vibrancy.</p>

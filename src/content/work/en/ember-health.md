    <p>Ember Health needed more than just a website—they needed a digital experience that embodied their mission: calm, clarity, and wellness. As a wellness startup focused on breathwork and recovery, their visual identity had to make users feel better just by scrolling.</p>
    <p>We designed an intentional, soothing environment that builds trust, reduces cognitive load, and gently guides users through Ember’s services.</p>
